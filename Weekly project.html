            Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, 
            Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, 
            the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, and 
            then recruited Dave Grohl in 1990.  Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.

            In the late 1980s, 
            Nirvana established itself as part of the 
            Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first 
            album, Bleach, for the independent record 
            label Sub Pop in 1989. 
            They developed a sound that relied on 
            dynamic contrasts, often between quiet 
            verses and loud, heavy choruses. 
            After signing to major label DGC 
            Records in 1991, Nirvana found
             unexpected mainstream success with 
             "Smells Like Teen Spirit", 
             the first single from their 
             landmark second album Nevermind (1991). 
             A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s,
              Nevermind was certified Diamond by 
              the RIAA and is credited for ending the 
              dominance of hair metal.

        Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, the band released their highly anticipated third studio album, In Utero (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Various posthumous releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album MTV Unplugged in New York (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.

            In  a track that features on the 2005 album In Your Honor but was actually written by Grohl in 1990. 'Friend of a Friend' is the song the newly-Nirvana man wrote while staying in Kurt's Olympia apartment after having moved to Seattle to join the band in what must have been some of his most exciting moments.
